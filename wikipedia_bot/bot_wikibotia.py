# differences:
# - bot is imported from the discord.ext.commands module
# - the bot initializer requires a command_prefix
#   command is an order that a user gives to a bot so that it will do sth.
#   commands are different from events because they are:
#       - arbitrarily defined
#       - directly called by the user
#       - flexible, in terms of their interface
