enhancements:
- can add a list to choose from (for example list of 5 first examples)
- if there is no such term, but can ask for other close term (is this what you are looking for?)

smaller things:
- maybe bot should also handle this kind of flags '--' e.g. '--french' or '--deutsch'

potential problems:
- !help can invoke help for every bot

e.g !wikipedia mariusz pudzianowski
e.g !wikipedia [deutsch] mariusz pudzianowski
