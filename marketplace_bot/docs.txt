Fleamarkt - allows users to sell & buy their unwanted stuff.

Important!
Communication with the bot is available only through DMs.
On Marketplace channel only Fleamarkt is allowed to post.

List of available commands:
    - !sell <what> <category> <price> <currency>
        - a user can put his item for sale. The user must provide item's name, category, price and currency.
        - it triggers a message in the marketplace channel that an item is for sale, other users can see it now.
    - !buy <item_ID>
        - user can buy a product by providing its unique ID
        - it triggers a message in the marketplace channel that a @user bought a product from @user
        - the owner and buyer will be informed by the bot through DMs to take action to finalize transaction
            sample messages:
            - owner -> @buyer bought your product (name of the product). Prepare item and get in contact with @buyer.
            - buyer -> you bought product from @buyer. Don't wait, get in contact with @buyer.
    - !show <nr_last_added> or all
        - this command provides a list of items for sale directly to the user
            - user can specify a number of n last added products (by default 5) or show all products listed for sale
    - !delete <what: id nr>
        - if the command is invoked by a user who is an owner of the product, it will remove the product for the list
    - !want <what> <cost> <currency>
        - this will trigger a message that a @user wants to buy sth in the marketplace channel
        - it allows users to communicate their needs

future enhancements:
- add !show by category (maybe only a few categories should be allowed to keep better consistency)
- can id_itertools reuse deleted ids?
- add tracking of sold items (e.g. deleted after 30 days)
- use database (mongodb) - this allows to store photos
