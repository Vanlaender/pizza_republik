how is it supposed to work:
- only this bot will be allowed to text in marketplace channel (regular users are not allowed)
- users will write to bot private messages with options !sell !buy !show
    - !sell <what> <price>
        - this will trigger a message in marketplace channel that an item is for sale added by @user
        - embed message is nice - discord.Embed()
    - !buy <what>
        - this will buy an item - user must provide id or name of the item
        - a special message will be posted in the marketplace channel - @user bought product from @user
        - the owner and buyer will be informed in dm
            - owner -> @buyer bought your product (name of the product). Prepare item and get in contact with @buyer
            - buyer -> you bought product from @buyer. Get in contact with @buyer
    - !show <category e.g. books, agd> or all
        - this will provide list of items for sale directly to the user
    - (later) !delete <what: id nr> if an asking user is an owner of the product, it can delete the product from list
    - (later) !want <what> this will trigger a message that a @user wants to buy sth in the marketplace


# to do:
- add sell method
- add buy method (doesn't work if there is no such item)
- save products to txt file (json format)
- restrict access to marketplace for other users

enhancements:
- if user is not sure what to do, bot can try to understand the message (read message) and if it sees a word e.g. sell
  then he explains how to sell a thing
- how to handle list of items for sale. It shouldn't be too long
- only a few categories should be allowed to keep better consistency
- adding db instead of json file - or just don't use database, cause bot will be constantly online
- in Product class id_itertools constantly increases its value, can it reuse deleted ids?
- database can also remember sold items, for example after 30 days they will be removed from database

potential problems:
- idk how hosting will affect db or txt file
