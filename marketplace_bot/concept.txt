how is it supposed to work:
- only this bot will be allowed to text in marketplace channel (regular users are not allowed)
- users will write to bot private messages with options !sell !buy !show
    - !sell <what> <category> <price> <amount>
        OK - this will add a product to the inventory
        OK - this will trigger a message in marketplace channel that an item is for sale added by @user
        OK - use discord.Embed()
    - !buy <what>
        OK - user must provide id of the item that he wants to buy
        OK - a special message will be posted in the marketplace channel - @user bought product from @user
        OK - the owner and buyer will be informed in dm
            - owner -> @buyer bought your product (name of the product). Prepare item and get in contact with @buyer
            - buyer -> you bought product from @buyer. Get in contact with @buyer
    - !show <nr_last_added> or all
        OK - this will provide list of items for sale directly to the user
    - OK !delete <what: id nr> if an asking user is an owner of the product, it can delete the product from list
    - OK !want <what> this will trigger a message that a @user wants to buy sth in the marketplace


# to do:
-

future enhancements:
- add !show by category (maybe only a few categories should be allowed to keep better consistency)
- can id_itertools reuse deleted ids?
- add tracking of sold items (e.g. deleted after 30 days)
- use database (mongodb) - this allows to store photos
