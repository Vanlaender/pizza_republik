how is it supposed to work:
- only this bot will be allowed to text in marketplace channel (regular users are not allowed)
- users will write to bot private messages with options !sell !buy !show
    - !sell <what> <category> <price> <amount>
        OK - this will add a product to the inventory
        OK - this will trigger a message in marketplace channel that an item is for sale added by @user
        OK - use discord.Embed()
    - !buy <what>
        OK - user must provide id of the item that he wants to buy
        OK - a special message will be posted in the marketplace channel - @user bought product from @user
        OK - the owner and buyer will be informed in dm
            - owner -> @buyer bought your product (name of the product). Prepare item and get in contact with @buyer
            - buyer -> you bought product from @buyer. Get in contact with @buyer
    - !show <nr_last_added> or all
        OK - this will provide list of items for sale directly to the user
    - OK !delete <what: id nr> if an asking user is an owner of the product, it can delete the product from list
    - OK !want <what> this will trigger a message that a @user wants to buy sth in the marketplace


# to do:
- delete message if user writes in marketplace channel (users can only write DMs to bot)

enhancements:
- if user is not sure what to do, bot can try to understand the message (read message) and if it sees a word e.g. sell
  then he explains how to sell a thing
- if a user wants to write sth in the marketplace channel, the bot it pop up in the dms and it will instantly remove
the message from the channel (don't allow users to message in the marketplace channel)
- add !show by category
- how to handle list of items for sale. It shouldn't be too long
- only a few categories should be allowed to keep better consistency
- adding db instead of json file - or just don't use database, cause bot will be constantly online
- in Product class id_itertools constantly increases its value, can it reuse deleted ids?
- add to help that if name has spaces then it must be provided in " "
- database can also remember sold items, for example after 30 days they will be removed from database


potential problems:
- idk how hosting will affect db or txt file
